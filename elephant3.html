        Elephants use their trunks like giant straws to drink water — but they don’t suck it all the way into their mouths! First, they slurp up about 8 liters of water into their trunks, then curl their trunks into their mouths to drink. Elephants can drink up to 200 liters of water in a single day to stay cool and hydrated in the hot sun!
