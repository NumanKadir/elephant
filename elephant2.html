        This baby elephant was just born! At birth, elephants can already weigh about 120 kilograms — that's as heavy as a small motorcycle! But don’t worry, they grow up slowly and stay close to their mothers for years. Newborns don’t have tusks yet, and they spend their early months learning how to use their trunks — sometimes even tripping over them!
